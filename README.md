It is essential to have NodeJS installed on the machine and configured as an environment variable in the case of Windows.
You can do the installation at this [link] (https://nodejs.org/en/) here.

With NodeJS installed, just clone this repository and run the command:
```
npm install
```

### Development compilation (with Hot-Reloads)
```
npm run serve
```

### Production Compilation (minifies the files)
```
npm run build
```

### Desktop compilation (development) w/ Electron
```
npm run electron:serve
```

### Desktop compilation (production) w/ Electron
```
npm run electron:build
```

### Remember to turn on the Backend before starting to use the application. :)
